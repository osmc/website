Keep a snippet library of text, HTML or PHP code to be used in posts. Variables
can be set for more flexibility. Inserts directly or as shortcodes.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you build a library with snippets of HTML, PHP code or
reoccurring text that you often use in your posts and pages. You can use
predefined variables to replace parts of the snippet on insert. All snippets are
available in the post editor via a button in the Visual and HTML modes. The
snippet can be inserted as defined, or as a shortcode to keep flexibility for
updating the snippet. PHP code is supported for snippets inserted as shortcodes.

= Features =

* **Insert** All defined snippets is inserted from a button directly in the post
  editor.
* **Shortcodes** You can use this plugin to create your own shortcodes.
* **PHP** A shortcode snippet can optionally be evaluated as PHP code.
* **Buttons** The snippets are available in the viusal editor with a TinyMCE
  button and in the HTML editor with a quicktag button.
* **Admin** Easy to use administration panel where you can add, edit and remove
  snippets.
* **Variables** Each snippet can have as many custom variables as you like,
  which can be used on insert.
* **Import/Export** Snippets can be imported and exported between sites.
* **Documentation** Full documentation is available directly from the help panel
  in the plugin administration screen.
* **Uninstall** If you delete the plugin from your plugins panel it cleans up
  all data it has created in the Wordpress database.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find usage and developer information? =

plugin administration screen.

= Why do importing Snippets on a multi site install fail? =

Upload of zip files must be allowed, enable this in Sites Network Admin ->
Settings -> Upload Settings -> Upload file types.

= How can I use the content in an enclosed shortcode? =

If the shortcode is enclosed and contains content between the tags in a post.
Example: `[shortcode]Some text[/shortcode]` the text within will be availble in
a variable called content. So in your snippet use {content} to display it. Don't
enter 'content' in the variable field, it's automatically assigned.
